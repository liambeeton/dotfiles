## Overview

Dotfiles are plain text configuration files on Unix-y systems for things like shells, editors, version control systems, and more. This repository is a collection of my personal dotfiles to set up a new system or synchronize settings across multiple systems.

## On a fresh install of macOS

```bash
sudo softwareupdate -i -a
xcode-select --install
softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license
```

## Installation

To get started with my dotfiles, you can clone this repository and run the installation script. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./install.sh
```

Make sure to back up any existing configuration files before running the installation script, as it may overwrite them.

## Usage

After installing, you can start using the configured tools and applications with my settings. Below are some examples of how to use them:

### Shell (zsh)

To use the zsh configuration, make sure zsh is installed and set as the default shell:

```bash
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

### Vim

Open Vim to use the included Vim configuration:

```bash
vim
```

### Git

My git configuration includes useful aliases and settings. Use git as usual:

```bash
git status
```

## Configuration

Feel free to customize the configurations to suit your preferences. Each configuration file is well-commented to explain what each setting does. You can modify the files directly in this repository or copy them to your home directory.
